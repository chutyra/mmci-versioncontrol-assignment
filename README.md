Where does it fall short?
DevOps is an actively changing environment with multiple changes happening in real time from multiple users in different domains.  GitHub can accept a multitude of changes to the master product line but in an environment where such changes are being pushed out to web domains or software code immediately, there is the possibility that changes might be publicly visible before sufficient oversight is applied.
