Description of Use Case

DevOps is an engineering movement or practice that ties together the development and operations of software â€“ two previously exclusive fields. As a result, IT and software professionals are able to shorten development cycles, deploy software more efficiently, and overall streamline software releases and infrastructure changes. The process of creating software is more cohesive and automatic as a result of the collaboration of all team members. 

Why is it a good use case for version control?

With the onset of the DevOps movement there is more need than ever for IT professionals to communicate differently and more collaboratively.  Version control supports this shift in working culture by allowing the people who build, test and release software to work together.  Version control simplifies this process by allowing changes to the source code to be tracked, edited and easily identified by any number of users.  Leveraging the tight integration with source control mechanisms (GIT) allows the initiation of a build process each time code is committed by a developer.  

Where does it fall short?

DevOps is an actively changing environment with multiple changes happening in real time from multiple users in different domains.  GitHub can accept a multitude of changes to the master product line but in an environment where such changes are being pushed out to web domains or software code immediately, there is the possibility that changes might be publicly visible before sufficient oversight is applied.  

What would you do differently?

Given the opportunity for malicious use of code, it is imperiative that users of GitHub either protect code with a private account (that is a paid option) or use another resource. One must accept the public nature of GitHub as a tool for version control when using the free service option. Making it into a company with a for-profit mission may exclude members from benefiting from the privacy available in a paid account. Offering privacy for free and other features that enhance the usability of the site may be a better business model to avoid any malicious use of the sites contents.
