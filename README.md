Why is it a good use case for version control?
With the onset of the DevOps movement there is more need than ever for IT professionals to communicate differently and more collaboratively.  Version control supports this shift in working culture by allowing the people who build, test and release software work together.  Version control simplifies this process by allowing changes to the source code be tracked, edited and allowing changes to be easily identifiable by any number of users.  Leveraging the tight integration with source control mechanisms (GIT) allows the initiation of a build process each time code is committed by a developer.

Where does it fall short?
DevOps is an actively changing environment with multiple changes happening in real time from multiple users in different domains.  GitHub can accept a multitude of changes to the master product line but in an environment where such changes are being pushed out to web domains or software code immediately, there is the possibility that changes might be publicly visible before sufficient oversight is applied.
